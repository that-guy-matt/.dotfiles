These are my new dotfiles. 
My old ones were a bit complex and at some point they stopped working properly and I didn't bother to fix them.
The goal of this version of my dotfiles is to simplify the system by using GNU stow instead of custom scripting.
I may add scripts in the future, but only if they will not add complexity. I want these dotfiles to easily install on any Linux system without a struggle.
My old dotfiles are still accessible through a branch labeled dotfiles-old.
