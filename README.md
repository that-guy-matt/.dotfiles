# .dotfiles
These are my dotfiles.

I discovered dotfiles while researching how to sync my system settings across multiple systems. 

The goal of these dotfiles are to sync and entirely install and setup my environment between systems...

This is very much a work in progress and as of right now, I have it set up with the most basic of settings.
I am basing a lot of my dotfiles on Zach Holman's dotfiles. I like his topical organization and his bootstrap/install system
and have borrowed a lot from them, so thanks Zach.

At the time of creation, this will only function on Ubuntu (or other debian based systems, I have not tested it on anything
beyond Ubuntu)
